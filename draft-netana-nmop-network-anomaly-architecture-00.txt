1.  Introduction

   Todays highly virtualized large scale IP networks are a challenge for
   network operation to monitor due to its vast amount of dependencies.
   Humans are no longer capable to verify manually all dependencies end
   to end in an appropriate time.

   IP networks are the backbone of todays society.  We individually
   depend on networks fulfilling the purpose of forwarding our IP
   packets from A to B at any time of the day in a timely fashion.  A
   loss of connectivity for a short period of time has manyfold
   implications.  From unable to browse the web, watch a soccer game,
   access the company intranet or even in life threatening situations
   being no longer able to reach emergency services.  Where increased
   packet forwarding delay due to congestion, depending on the real-time
   character of the network application, have none to severe impact on
   the performance of the application.

   Networks are in general deterministic.  However the usage of networks
   only somewhat.  Humans, as in a large group of people, are somehow
   predictable.  There are time of the day patterns in terms of when we
   are eating, sleeping, working or leisure.  And these patterns are
   potentially changing depending on age, profession and cultural
   background.

1.1.  Motivation

   When operational or configurational changes in connectivity services
   are happening, the objective therefore is to detect interruption at
   network operation faster then the users using those connectivity
   services.

   In order to achieve this objective, automation in network monitoring
   is required since the amount or people operating the network are
   simply outnumbered by the amount of people using connectivity
   services.

   This automation needs to monitor network changes holistically by
   monitoring all 3 network planes simultaneously for a given
   connectivity service and detect wherever that change is service
   disruptive, received packets are no longer forwarded to the desired
   destination, or not.  A change in control and management plane
   indicate a network topology change.  Where a change in the forwarding
   plane describe how the packets are being forwarded.  Or in other
   words, control and management plane changes can be attributed to
   network state changes where forwarding plane to the outcome of these
   network state changes.

   Since changes in networks are happening all the time due to the vast
   amount of dependencies, a scoring system is needed to indicate
   wherever the change is disruptive, the amount of transport sessions,
   flows, are affected and wherever such interruptions are usual or
   exceptional.

1.2.  Scope

   Such objectives can be achieved by applying checks on network
   modelled time series data containing semantics describing their
   dependencies across network planes.  These checks can be based on
   domain knowledge, in essence how networks work and on outlier
   detection techniques when measurements are changing over time due to
   human factors.

   The described scope does not take the connectivity service intend
   into account nor does it verify wherever the intend is being achieved
   all the time.  Changes to the service intend causing service
   disruptions are therefore considered service disruptions where on
   monitoring systems taking the intend into account this is considered
   as intended.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Terminology

   This document defines the following terms:

   Message Broker: is an intermediary software component that translates
   messages from the formal messaging protocol of the sender to the
   formal messaging protocol of the receiver routed in topics.  Message
   brokers are elements in Data Mesh where software applications
   communicate by exchanging formally-defined messages.

   Stream Catalog: provides a single point of access that allows users
   to centrally search semantics for information across a Message
   Broker.

   Additionally it makes use of the terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology].

   The following terms are used as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology]:

   *  System

   *  Resource

2.2.  Outlier Detection

   Outlier Detection, also known as anomaly detection, describes a
   systematic approach to identify rare data points deviating
   significantly from the majority.  Outliers can manifest as single
   data point or as a sequence of data points.  There are multiple ways
   in general to classify anomalies, but for the context of this draft,
   the following three classes are taken into account:

   Global outliers:  An outlier is considered "global" if its behaviour
      is outside the entirety of the considered data set.  For example,
      if the average dropped packet count is between 0 and 10 per minute
      and a small time-window gets the value 1000, this is considered a
      global anomaly.

Internet-Draft     Network Anomaly Detection Framework         June 2024


   Contextual outliers:  An outlier is considered "contextual" if its
      behaviour is within a normal (expected) range, but it would not be
      expected based on some context.  Context can be defined as a
      function of multiple parameters, such as time, location, etc.  For
      example, the forwarded packet volume overnight reaches levels
      which might be totally normal for the daytime, but anomalous and
      unexpected for the nighttime.

   Collective outliers:  An outlier is considered "collective" if the
      behaviour of each single data point that are part of the anomaly
      are within expected ranges (so they are not anomalous it either a
      contextual or a global sense), but the group, taking all the data
      points together, is.  Note that the group can be made within a
      single time series (a sequence of data points is anomalous) or
      across multiple metrics (e.g. if looking at two metrics together,
      the combined behavior turns out to be anomalous).  In Network
      Telemetry time series, one way this can manifest is that the
      amount of network paths and interface state changes matches the
      time range when the forwarded packet volume decreases as a group.

   For each outlier a score between 0 and 1 is being calculated.  The
   higher the value, the higher the probability that the observed data
   point is an outlier.  Anomaly detection: A survey [VAP09] gives
   additional details on anomaly detection and its types.

2.4.  Data Mesh

   The Data Mesh [Deh22] Architecture distinguishes between operational
   and analytical data.  Operational data refers to collected data from
   operational systems.  While analytical data refers to insights gained
   from operational data.

2.4.1.  Operational Network Data

   In terms of network observability, semantics of operational network
   metrics are defined by IETF and are categorized as described in the
   Network Telemetry Framework [RFC9232] in the following three
   different network planes:

   Management Plane:  Time series data describing the state changes and
      statistics of a network node and its components.  For example,
      Interface state and statistics modelled in ietf-interfaces.yang
      [RFC8343]

Internet-Draft     Network Anomaly Detection Framework         June 2024


   Control Plane:  Time series data describing the state and state
      changes of network reachability.  For example, BGP VPNv6 unicast
      updates and withdrawals exported in BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)
      [RFC7854] and modeled in BGP [RFC4364]

   Forwarding Plane:  Time series data describing the forwarding
      behavior of packets and its data-plane context.  For example,
      dropped packet count modelled in IPFIX entity
      forwardingStatus(IE89) [RFC7270] and packetDeltaCount(IE2)
      [RFC5102] and exportet with IPFIX [RFC7011].
