       An Architecture for a Network Anomaly Detection Framework
           draft-netana-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture-00

Abstract

   This document describes the motivation and architecture of a Network
   Anomaly Detection Framework and the relationship to other documents
   describing network symptom semantics and network incident lifecycle.

   The described architecture for detecting network service interruption
   is generic applicable and extensible.  Different applications are
   being described and exampled with open-source running code.

1.  Introduction

   Todays highly virtualized large scale networks are a challenge for
   network operation to monitor due to its vast amount of dependencies.
   Humans are no longer capable to verify manually all dependencies end
   to end in an appropriate time.

   IP networks are the backbone of todays society.  We individually
   depend on networks fulfilling the purpose of forwarding our IP
   packets from A to B at any time of the day in a timely fashion.  A
   loss of connectivity for a short period of time can have manyfold
   implications.  From unable to browse the web, watch a soccer game,
   access the company intranet or even in life threatening situations
   bein no longer able to reach emergency services.  Where increased
   packet forwarding delay due to congestion, depend on the real-time
   character of the network application, have none to severe impact on
   the performance of the application.

   Networks are in general deterministic.  However the usage of the
   network only somewhat.  Humans, as in a large group of people, are
   somehow predictable.  There are time of the day patterns in terms of
   when we are eating, sleeping, working or leisure.  And these patterns
   are potentially changing depending on age and profession.

1.1.  Motivation

   When operational or configurational changes in connectivity services
   are happening, the objective therefore is to detect interruption at
   network operation faster then the users using those connectivity
   services.

   In order to achieve this objective, automation in network monitoring
   is required since the amount or people operating the network are
   simply outnumbered by the amount of people using connectivity
   services.

   This automation needs to monitor network changes holistically by
   monitoring all 3 network planes simultaneously for a given
   connectivity service and detect wherever that change is a service
   disruptive, received packets are no longer forwarded to the desired
   destination, or not.  A change in control and management plane
   indicate a network topology change.  Where a change in the forwarding
   plane describe how the packets are being forwarded.  Or in other
   words, control and management plane changes can be attributed to
   network state changes where forwarding plane to the outcome of these
   network state changes.

   Since changes in networks are happening all the time due to the vast
   amount of dependencies, a scoring system is needed to indicate
   wherever the change is disruptive, the amount of transport sessions,
   flows, are affected and wherever such interruptions are usual or
   exceptional.

1.2.  Scope

   Such objectives can be achieved by applying checks on network
   modelled time series data containing semantics describing their
   dependencies across network planes.  These checks can be based on
   domain knowledge, in essence how networks work and on outlier
   detection techniques when measurements are changing over time due to
   human factors.

   The described scope does not take the connectivity service intend
   into account nor does it verify wherever the intend is being achieved
   all the time.  Changes to the service intend causing service
   disruptions are therefore considered service disruptions where on
   monitoring systems taking the intend into account this is considered
   as intended.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Terminology

   This document defines the following terms:

   Message Broker: is an intermediary software component that translates
   messages from the formal messaging protocol of the sender to the
   formal messaging protocol of the receiver routed in topics.  Message
   brokers are elements in Data Mesh where software applications
   communicate by exchanging formally-defined messages.

   Stream Catalog: provides a single point of access that allows users
   to centrally search semantics for information across a Message
   Broker.

   Additionally it makes use of the terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology].

   The following terms are used as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology]:

   *  System

   *  Resource
