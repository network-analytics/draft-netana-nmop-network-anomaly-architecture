    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>Todays highly virtualized large scale IP networks are a challenge for
      network operation to monitor due to its vast amount of dependencies.
      Humans are no longer capable to verify manually all dependencies end to
      end in an appropriate time.</t>

      <t>IP networks are the backbone of todays society. We individually
      depend on networks fulfilling the purpose of forwarding our IP packets
      from A to B at any time of the day in a timely fashion. A loss of
      connectivity for a short period of time has manyfold implications. From
      unable to browse the web, watch a soccer game, access the company
      intranet or even in life threatening situations being no longer able to
      reach emergency services. Where increased packet forwarding delay due to
      congestion, depending on the real-time character of the network
      application, have none to severe impact on the performance of the
      application.</t>

      <t>Networks are in general deterministic. However the usage of networks
      only somewhat. Humans, as in a large group of people, are somehow
      predictable. There are time of the day patterns in terms of when we are
      eating, sleeping, working or leisure. And these patterns are potentially
      changing depending on age, profession and cultural background.</t>

      <section anchor="Motivation" title="Motivation">
        <t>When operational or configurational changes in connectivity
        services are happening, the objective therefore is to detect
        interruption at network operation faster then the users using those
        connectivity services.</t>

        <t>In order to achieve this objective, automation in network
        monitoring is required since the amount or people operating the
        network are simply outnumbered by the amount of people using
        connectivity services.</t>

        <t>This automation needs to monitor network changes holistically by
        monitoring all 3 network planes simultaneously for a given
        connectivity service and detect wherever that change is service
        disruptive, received packets are no longer forwarded to the desired
        destination, or not. A change in control and management plane indicate
        a network topology change. Where a change in the forwarding plane
        describe how the packets are being forwarded. Or in other words,
        control and management plane changes can be attributed to network
        state changes where forwarding plane to the outcome of these network
        state changes.</t>

        <t>Since changes in networks are happening all the time due to the
        vast amount of dependencies, a scoring system is needed to indicate
        wherever the change is disruptive, the amount of transport sessions,
        flows, are affected and wherever such interruptions are usual or
        exceptional.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="Scope" title="Scope">
        <t>Such objectives can be achieved by applying checks on network
        modelled time series data containing semantics describing their
        dependencies across network planes. These checks can be based on
        domain knowledge, in essence how networks work and on outlier
        detection techniques when measurements are changing over time due to
        human factors.</t>

        <t>The described scope does not take the connectivity service intend
        into account nor does it verify wherever the intend is being achieved
        all the time. Changes to the service intend causing service
        disruptions are therefore considered service disruptions where on
        monitoring systems taking the intend into account this is considered
        as intended.</t>

      <section anchor="Outlier_Detection" title="Outlier Detection">
        <t>Outlier Detection, also known as anomaly detection, describes a
        systematic approach to identify rare data points deviating
        significantly from the majority. Outliers can manifest as single data
        point or as a sequence of data points. There are multiple ways in
        general to classify anomalies, but for the context of this draft, the
        following three classes are taken into account:</t>

        <dl>
          <dt>Global outliers:</dt>

          <dd>An outlier is considered "global" if its behaviour is outside
          the entirety of the considered data set. For example, if the average
          dropped packet count is between 0 and 10 per minute and a small
          time-window gets the value 1000, this is considered a global
          anomaly.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>Contextual outliers:</dt>

          <dd>An outlier is considered "contextual" if its behaviour is within
          a normal (expected) range, but it would not be expected based on
          some context. Context can be defined as a function of multiple
          parameters, such as time, location, etc. For example, the forwarded
          packet volume overnight reaches levels which might be totally normal
          for the daytime, but anomalous and unexpected for the
          nighttime.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>Collective outliers:</dt>

          <dd>An outlier is considered "collective" if the behaviour of each
          single data point that are part of the anomaly are within expected
          ranges (so they are not anomalous it either a contextual or a global
          sense), but the group, taking all the data points together, is. Note
          that the group can be made within a single time series (a sequence
          of data points is anomalous) or across multiple metrics (e.g. if
          looking at two metrics together, the combined behavior turns out to
          be anomalous). In Network Telemetry time series, one way this can
          manifest is that the amount of network paths and interface state
          changes matches the time range when the forwarded packet volume
          decreases as a group.</dd>
        </dl>

        <t>For each outlier a score between 0 and 1 is being calculated. The
        higher the value, the higher the probability that the observed data
        point is an outlier. <xref target="VAP09">Anomaly detection: A
        survey</xref> gives additional details on anomaly detection and its
        types.</t>

        <t>The <xref target="Deh22">Data Mesh</xref> Architecture

            <dd>Time series data describing the state and state changes of
