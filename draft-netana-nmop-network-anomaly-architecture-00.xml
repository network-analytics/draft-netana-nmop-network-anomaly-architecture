    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the motivation and architecture of a Network
      Anomaly Detection Framework and the relationship to other documents
      describing network symptom semantics and network incident lifecycle.</t>

      <t>The described architecture for detecting network service interruption
      is generic applicable and extensible. Different applications are being
      described and exampled with open-source running code.</t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>Todays highly virtualized large scale networks are a challenge for
      network operation to monitor due to its vast amount of dependencies.
      Humans are no longer capable to verify manually all dependencies end to
      end in an appropriate time.</t>

      <t>IP networks are the backbone of todays society. We individually
      depend on networks fulfilling the purpose of forwarding our IP packets
      from A to B at any time of the day in a timely fashion. A loss of
      connectivity for a short period of time can have manyfold implications.
      From unable to browse the web, watch a soccer game, access the company
      intranet or even in life threatening situations bein no longer able to
      reach emergency services. Where increased packet forwarding delay due to
      congestion, depend on the real-time character of the network
      application, have none to severe impact on the performance of the
      application.</t>

      <t>Networks are in general deterministic. However the usage of the
      network only somewhat. Humans, as in a large group of people, are
      somehow predictable. There are time of the day patterns in terms of when
      we are eating, sleeping, working or leisure. And these patterns are
      potentially changing depending on age and profession.</t>

      <section anchor="Motivation" title="Motivation">
        <t>When operational or configurational changes in connectivity
        services are happening, the objective therefore is to detect
        interruption at network operation faster then the users using those
        connectivity services.</t>

        <t>In order to achieve this objective, automation in network
        monitoring is required since the amount or people operating the
        network are simply outnumbered by the amount of people using
        connectivity services.</t>

        <t>This automation needs to monitor network changes holistically by
        monitoring all 3 network planes simultaneously for a given
        connectivity service and detect wherever that change is a service
        disruptive, received packets are no longer forwarded to the desired
        destination, or not. A change in control and management plane indicate
        a network topology change. Where a change in the forwarding plane
        describe how the packets are being forwarded. Or in other words,
        control and management plane changes can be attributed to network
        state changes where forwarding plane to the outcome of these network
        state changes.</t>

        <t>Since changes in networks are happening all the time due to the
        vast amount of dependencies, a scoring system is needed to indicate
        wherever the change is disruptive, the amount of transport sessions,
        flows, are affected and wherever such interruptions are usual or
        exceptional.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="Scope" title="Scope">
        <t>Such objectives can be achieved by applying checks on network
        modelled time series data containing semantics describing their
        dependencies across network planes. These checks can be based on
        domain knowledge, in essence how networks work and on outlier
        detection techniques when measurements are changing over time due to
        human factors.</t>

        <t>The described scope does not take the connectivity service intend
        into account nor does it verify wherever the intend is being achieved
        all the time. Changes to the service intend causing service
        disruptions are therefore considered service disruptions where on
        monitoring systems taking the intend into account this is considered
        as intended.</t>

      <section anchor="Terminology" title="Terminology">
        <t>This document defines the following terms:</t>

        <t>Message Broker: is an intermediary software component that
        translates messages from the formal messaging protocol of the sender
        to the formal messaging protocol of the receiver routed in topics.
        Message brokers are elements in Data Mesh where software applications
        communicate by exchanging formally-defined messages.</t>

        <t>Stream Catalog: provides a single point of access that allows users
        to centrally search semantics for information across a Message
        Broker.</t>
